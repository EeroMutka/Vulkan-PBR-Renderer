# Vulkan PBR Renderer

Physically based Vulkan renderer demo with dynamic global illumination. Not production-ready by any means, this is just a personal project which I put up for educational purposes.

## Building

Prerequisites:
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) (tested on 1.3.268)

If you have Visual Studio 2022, you can open `build_projects/VulkanRenderer.sln` to build and run the demos.
Otherwise, you can download [premake5](https://premake.github.io/download) and run `premake5.exe [target]` in the repository directory to generate the project files.
